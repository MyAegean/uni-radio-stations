## About the Catalogue for College/University Radio Stations


### A list for College/University Radios in Greece, Cyprus and other Countries

<p>This is a side-project of My.Aegean.gr initiative of the University of the Aegean, Greece. We try to gather info and collaborate in building a rich list of College/University Radio Stations. This is a volunteering project with a non-profit scope.</p>

<p>Station list builds a webpage of a Catalogue and a Maps embeddable webpage as well. We also build some custom mini-players for creating a webring of all radio stations, offering an easy access for listeners to get to them. We try to keep information up-to-date and accurate, for everyone to access it and we hope we can expand the list of stations for other countries as well. Feel free to help us! Thank you! :)</p>

## About MyAegean

<p>The idea of <em>"my Aegean"</em> originated in 2002 with a group of students from the University of the Aegean. The aim of this initiative was to create a network portal for the whole of the Aegean University community by utilising any available technology.<br>Our aspiration is to create <strong>a vehicle which will encourage and promote direct, collective and qualitative communication and information exchange, without geographical restrictions, among all members of the Aegean community</strong> (students, academic and research staff, as well as administrative, technical or other personnel). <em>myAegean</em> is to serve as a common point of reference, as a scheme which will stimulate and facilitate interaction among all the members of the university.</p>
